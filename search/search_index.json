Welcome to the official repository! Why AR.js We believe in the Web, a collaborative and accessible place. We also believe in the Augmented Reality technology, as a new communication medium, that can help people to see the reality in new, exciting ways. We see Augmented Reality (AR) used everyday for a lot of useful applications, from art, to education, also for fun. We strongly believe that such a powerful technology, that can help people and leverage their creativity, should be free in some way. Also collaborative, if possible. And so, we continue the work started by Jerome Etienne, in bringing AR on the Web, as a free and Open Source technology. Thank you for being interested in this, if you'd like to collaborate in any way, contact us ( https://twitter.com/nicolocarp ). The project is now under a Github organization, that you can find at https://github.com/ar-js-org . AR types It features the following types of Augmented Reality, on the Web: Image Tracking Location Based AR Marker Tracking. Key points Very Fast : It runs efficiently even on phones Web-based : It is a pure web solution, so no installation required. Full javascript based on three.js + A-Frame + jsartoolkit5 Open Source : It is completely open source and free of charge!

For frequent updates on AR.js you can follow @nicolocarp and Watch this repo! After months of work, we have changed AR.js for good. The aim was to make it a true, free alternative to paid Web AR solutions. We don't know if we're already there, but now the path is clear, at least. We have worked hard, spent many days and nights\u200a-\u200aobviously, we are coders, what did you expect?\u200a-\u200aand we are now so thrilled to share this achievement with the community. We know that it can be better, we know its limitations, but we would love to share this journey's result. AR.js is now under a Github organisation, that means, more collaborative than ever. It has a new structure, and a lot of new code. And most of all, we've added Image Tracking, what we felt was the missing piece for a true alternative to Web AR. A huge, huge thanks to the wonderful guys who made this possible: Walter Perdan Thorsten Bux Daniel Fernandes misdake hatsumatsu and many more. It was great to built this with all of you.","title":"About"},{"location":"image-tracking/","text":"","title":"Image Tracking"},{"location":"location-based/","text":"","title":"Location Based"},{"location":"marker-based/","text":"","title":"Marker Based"},{"location":"tools/","text":"","title":"Tools"}]}
