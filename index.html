<h1 id="arjs-augmented-reality-on-the-web">AR.js - Augmented Reality on the Web</h1>
<p><img src="./logo.png" height="200" /></p>
<hr />
<p>AR.js is a lightweight library for Augmented Reality on the Web, which includes features like Image Tracking, Location based AR and Marker tracking.</p>
<p><strong>Location Based documentation updated and enhanced for AR.js 3.4</strong></p>
<h2 id="what-web-ar-means-augmented-reality-on-the-web">What Web AR means (Augmented Reality on the Web)</h2>
<p>Augmented Reality is the technology that makes possible to overlay content on the real world.
It can be provided for several type of devices: handheld (like mobile phones), headsets, desktop
displays, and so on.</p>
<p>For handheld devices (more generally, for video-see-through devices) the 'reality' is captured
from one or more cameras and then shown on the device display, adding some kind of content on top of it.</p>
<hr />
<p><img src="./intro-image.gif"/></p>
<p>For developers, to develop Augmented Reality ('AR' from now on) on the Web, means to avoid all the
Mobile app development efforts and costs related to App stores (validation, time to publish). It also means to re-use well known technologies like Javascript, HTML and CSS, familiar to a lot of developers and possibly designers.</p>
<p>It basically means that it is possible to release every new version instantly, fix bugs or release
new features in near real-time, opening a lot of practical possibilities.</p>
<p>For users, it means to reach an AR experience just visiting a website. As QR Codes are now
widespread, it's also possible to scan a QR Code and reach the URL without typing.
Additionally, users do not have to reserve storage space on their download the AR app,
and do not have to keep it updated.</p>
<h2 id="why-arjs">Why AR.js</h2>
<p>We believe in the Web, as a collaborative and accessible environment. We also believe in Augmented Reality technology, as a new communication medium, that can help people see reality in new, exciting ways. We see Augmented Reality (AR) used everyday for a lot of useful applications, from art, to education, also for fun.</p>
<p>We strongly believe that such a powerful technology, that can help people and leverage their creativity, should be free in some way. Also collaborative, if possible. And so, we continue the work started by Jerome Etienne, in bringing AR on the Web, as a free and Open Source technology.</p>
<p>Thank you for being interested in this, if you'd like to collaborate in any way, contact us (<a href="https://twitter.com/nicolocarp">https://twitter.com/nicolocarp</a>).</p>
<p>The project is now under a Github organization, that you can find at <a href="https://github.com/ar-js-org">https://github.com/ar-js-org</a> and you can ask to be part of it, for free.</p>
<h3 id="ar-types">AR types</h3>
<p>AR.js features the following types of Augmented Reality, on the Web:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Image Tracking</strong>, when a 2D images is found by the camera, it's possible to show some kind of content on top of it, or near it. The content can be a 2D image, a GIF, a 3D model (also animated) and a 2D video too.
Cases of use: Augmented Art, learning (Augmented books), Augmented flyers, advertising, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Location Based AR</strong>, this kind of AR uses real-world places in order to show Augmented Reality content, on the user device.
The experiences that can be built with this library are those that use a user's position in
the real world. The user can move (ideally outdoor) and through their smartphones they can see AR
content where places are in the real world. Moving around and rotating the phone will make the AR
content change according to users position and rotation (so places are 'anchored' in their real
position, and appear bigger/smaller according to their distance from the user). With this solution it’s possible to build experiences like interactive support for tourist guides, assistance when exploring a new city, find places of interest like buildings, museums, restaurants, hotels and so on. It’s also possible to build learning experiences like treasure hunts, and biology or history learning games, or use this technology for situated art (visual art experiences bound to specific real world
coordinates).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Marker Tracking</strong>, When a marker is found by the camera, it's possible to show some content (same as Image Tracking). Markers are very stable but limited in shape, color and size. It is suggested for those  experiences where are required a lot of different markers with different content. Examples of use: (Augmented books), Augmented flyers, advertising.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="key-points">Key points</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Very Fast</strong> : It runs efficiently even on phones</li>
<li><strong>Web-based</strong> : It is a pure web solution, so no installation required. Fully javascript based, using three.js + A-Frame + jsartoolkit5</li>
<li><strong>Open Source</strong> : It is completely open source and free of charge!</li>
<li><strong>Standards</strong> : It works on any phone with <a href="http://caniuse.com/#feat=webgl">webgl</a> and <a href="http://caniuse.com/#feat=stream">webrtc</a></li>
</ul>
<p>AR.js has reached version 3. This is the official repository: <a href="https://github.com/AR-js-org/AR.js">https://github.com/AR-js-org/AR.js</a>.
If you want to visit the old AR.js repository, here it is: <a href="https://github.com/jeromeetienne/AR.js">https://github.com/jeromeetienne/AR.js</a>.</p>
<h2 id="import-the-library">Import the library</h2>
<p>AR.js from version 3 has a new structure.</p>
<p><strong>AR.js comes in two, different builds. They are both maintained. They are exclusive.</strong></p>
<p>The file you want to import depends on what features you want, and also which render library you want to use (A-Frame or three.js).</p>
<p>AR.js uses <a href="https://github.com/artoolkitx/jsartoolkit5">jsartoolkit5</a> for tracking, but can display augmented content with either <a href="https://threejs.org/">three.js</a> or <a href="https://aframe.io/">A-Frame</a>.</p>
<p>You can import AR.js in one version of your choice, using the <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag on your HTML.</p>
<p>The examples below assume the latest version of AR.js from the <code>master</code> branch, but you can replace <code>master</code> with a specific version, e.g. <code>3.4.7</code> for the latest version.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>AR.js with Image Tracking</strong></p>
<p>Import AFRAME version:</p>
<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;script src=&quot;https://raw.githack.com/AR-js-org/AR.js/master/aframe/build/aframe-ar-nft.js&quot;&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Import three.js version:</p>
<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;script src=&quot;https://raw.githack.com/AR-js-org/AR.js/master/three.js/build/ar-nft.js&quot;&gt;
</code></pre>
<hr />
<p><strong>AR.js with Marker Tracking</strong></p>
<p>Import AFRAME version:</p>
<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;script src=&quot;https://raw.githack.com/AR-js-org/AR.js/master/aframe/build/aframe-ar.js&quot;&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Import three.js version:</p>
<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;script src=&quot;https://raw.githack.com/AR-js-org/AR.js/master/three.js/build/ar.js&quot;&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>If you want to import a specific version, you can do that easily replacing <code>master</code> with the version tag, e.g.:</p>
<pre><code class="language-html">  &lt;script src=&quot;https://raw.githack.com/AR-js-org/AR.js/3.0.0/aframe/build/aframe-ar-nft.js&quot;&gt;
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Location-based AR.js</strong></p>
<p>It's recommended to use the new AR.js project <a href="https://github.com/AR-js-org/locar.js">LocAR.js</a> instead of the main repository, as this will be maintained more frequently and will take priority when it comes to bugfixes and new features. In particular, LocAR.js incorporates a number of fixes and improvements for iOS (Chrome and Safari).</p>
<p>If using the main repository, it's recommended to use version 3.4.7, rather than master:</p>
<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;!-- A-Frame itself --&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;https://aframe.io/releases/1.6.0/aframe.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;!-- Pure three.js code that the A-Frame components use for location-based AR --&gt;
&lt;script type='text/javascript' src='https://raw.githack.com/AR-js-org/AR.js/3.4.7/three.js/build/ar-threex-location-only.js'&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;!-- AR.js A-Frame components --&gt;
&lt;script type='text/javascript' src='https://raw.githack.com/AR-js-org/AR.js/3.4.7/aframe/build/aframe-ar.js'&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>
<h2 id="requirements-and-known-issues">Requirements and Known Issues</h2>
<p>Some requirements and known issues are listed below:</p>
<ul>
<li>It works on every phone with <a href="http://caniuse.com/#feat=webgl">webgl</a> and <a href="http://caniuse.com/#feat=stream">webrtc</a>.</li>
<li>Marker based tracking is very lightweight, while Image Tracking is more CPU consuming</li>
<li>You must ensure that you have matching versions of AR.js and A-Frame. AR.js 3.4.7 (the latest version) requires A-Frame 1.6.0 while AR.js 3.4.4 and below require 1.0.4.</li>
<li>Location-based AR will not work correctly on Firefox, due to the inability to obtain absolute device orientation (compass bearing).</li>
<li>On Android/Chrome, you may <strong>encounter issues with location-based AR due to inaccuracies in compass calibration</strong> (incorrect north). This is likely to be a hardware limitation of the device.</li>
<li>On some phones you may encounter problems with locating North due to inherent miscalibrations of the device sensors. This is a known problem recognised by the three.js developers: see <a href="https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/issues/22654">here</a></li>
<li>Please ensure you <strong>enable high accuracy</strong> location for your selected browser on Android. Sometimes high accuracy location is turned off by default, and this will lead to an inaccurate GPS location.</li>
<li>There is currently a bug in location-based AR where the camera feed is stretched away from the centre of the screen, meaning that there is reduced accuracy in placement of objects further away from the centre. Work is ongoing to investigate this.</li>
<li>On device with multi-cameras, Chrome may have problems on detecting the right one. Please use Firefox if you find that AR.js opens on the wrong camera. There is an open issue for this.</li>
<li>To work with Location Based feature, your device needs to have GPS, accelerometer and magnetometer sensors. It will not work if any of these sensors are absent.</li>
<li>Please, read carefully any suggestions that AR.js pops-up -as alerts- for Location Based on iOS, as iOS requires user actions to activate geoposition.
Access to the phone camera or to camera GPS sensors, due to major browsers restrictions, can be done only under https websites.</li>
</ul>
<p>All the examples you will see, and all AR.js web apps in general, have to be run on a server. You can use local server or deploy the static web app on the web.</p>
<h3 id="always-deploy-under-https">Always deploy under https</h3>
<p>So don't forget to always run your examples on secure connections servers or localhost. <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a> is a great way to have free and live websites under https.</p>
<h2 id="getting-started">Getting started</h2>
<p>Here we present three, basic examples, one for each AR feature. For specific documentation, on the top menu you can find every section, or you can click on the following links:</p>

<p>This is just a basic example and most location-based applications will involve JavaScript coding. So, if you want to enhance and customize your Location Based experience, take a look at the <a href="./location-based"> Location Based docs.</a></p>
<h3 id="marker-based-example">Marker Based Example</h3>
<p>Please follow these simple steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a new project with the code below (or <a href="https://ar-js-org.github.io/.github/profile/aframe/examples/marker-based/basic.html">open this live example</a> and go directly to the last step)</li>
<li>Run it on a server</li>
<li>Open the website on your phone</li>
<li>Scan <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AR-js-org/AR.js/master/data/images/hiro.png">this picture</a> to see content through the camera.</li>

<h3 id="advanced-stuff">Advanced stuff</h3>
<p>AR.js offers two ways, with A-Frame, to interact with the web page: to interact directly with AR content and Overlayed DOM interaction.</p>
<p>Also, there are several Custom Events triggered during the life cycle of every AR.js web app.</p>
<p>You can learn more about these aspects on the <a href="ui-events/">UI and Events section</a>.</p>
<h3 id="arjs-architecture">AR.js architecture</h3>
<p>AR.js uses <a href="https://github.com/artoolkitx/jsartoolkit5">jsartoolkit5</a> for tracking, but can display augmented content with either <a href="https://threejs.org/">three.js</a> or <a href="https://aframe.io/">A-Frame</a>.</p>
<p><code>three.js</code> folder contains</p>
<ul>
<li>source code for AR.js core, Marker based and Image Tracking</li>
<li>examples for AR.js three.js based</li>
<li>build for three.js AR.js based</li>
<li>vendor stuff (jsartoolkit5)</li>
<li>workers (used for Image Tracking).</li>
</ul>
<p>When you find files that ends with <code>-nft</code> suffix, they're bundled only with the Image Tracking version.</p>
<p>A-Frame version of AR.js uses three.js parts as its core. A-Frame code, on AR.js, is simply a wrapper to write AR with Custom Components in HTML.</p>
<p><code>aframe</code> folder contains</p>
<ul>
<li>source code for AR.js A-Frame (aka wrappers for Marker Based, Image Tracking components)</li>
<li>source code for Location Based</li>
<li>build for A-Frame AR.js based</li>
