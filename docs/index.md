AR.js is a lightweight library for Augmented Reality on the Web, coming with features like Image Tracking, Location based AR and Marker tracking.

Welcome to the official repository!

## Why AR.js

We believe in the Web, a collaborative and accessible place. We also believe in the Augmented Reality technology, as a new communication medium, that can help people to see the reality in new, exciting ways. We see Augmented Reality (AR) used everyday for a lot of useful applications, from art, to education, also for fun.

We strongly believe that such a powerful technology, that can help people and leverage their creativity, should be free in some way. Also collaborative, if possible. And so, we continue the work started by Jerome Etienne, in bringing AR on the Web, as a free and Open Source technology.

Thank you for being interested in this, if you'd like to collaborate in any way, contact us ([https://twitter.com/nicolocarp](https://twitter.com/nicolocarp)).

The project is now under a Github organization, that you can find at [https://github.com/ar-js-org](https://github.com/ar-js-org).
