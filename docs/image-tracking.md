# Image Tracking

Image Tracking makes possible to scan a picture, drawing, any image, and show content over it.

All the following examples are with A-Frame, for semplicity. You can use three.js if you want. See on the official repository the [three.js examples](https://github.com/AR-js-org/AR.js/tree/master/three.js/examples), search for 'nft' example.

All A-Frame examples for Image Tracking can be found [here](https://github.com/AR-js-org/AR.js/tree/master/aframe/examples/image-tracking/).
