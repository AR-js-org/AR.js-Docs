# Location-based AR.js with three.js

In the `dev` branch, a three.js API for location-based AR has now been implemented. Here is a series of tutorials taking you through how to use it, from the basics to more advanced examples communicating with web APIs. 

**Do note that unfortunately, due to issues with underlying browser APIs, you will need to use Chrome on Android if testing on a mobile device.**
